    question: "When to use Functional Components?",
    answer:
      "Functional components should be used when you have simple components that do not require state or lifecycle methods. They are also ideal when you want to keep your code simple and easy to understand. Functional components are a great choice for building small and simple components like buttons, input fields, and labels. Functional components are recommended for building presentational components.",

    question: "Why are functional components called stateless components ?",
    answer:
      "functional components are also referred to as stateless components because they merely accept data and render it in some way, they are mostly in charge of rendering user interfaces. To make functional components stateful, hooks can be used with ease. Example: const [name,SetName]= React.useState(‘ ‘)",

    question:
      "why is it suggested to use Fucntional components over Class Components ?",
    answer:
      "Functional components are more efficient and require fewer lines of code and are easy to understand. With React Hooks in React version 16.8, we can use state and other React features, in a functional component. It empowers devs to do functional programming in React.",
